Contributors
=====================
I am interested in contributors that may have relevant experience, information, that I am not supplying yet. For example, here are some possible topics/chapters that would probably improve the book:
- IE specific debugging via the IE8 JavaScript debugger would be a great addition.
- Integration with a continuous integration system.
Note that the goal of the book is to be short and sweet so contributions will need to be to the point.
